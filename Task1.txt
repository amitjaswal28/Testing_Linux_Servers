Objective: Configure a monitoring system to ensure the development environmentâ€™s health, performance, and capacity planning.

steps :
Install htop and nmon for monitoring CPU, memory, and processes:
sudo apt install htop nmon -y

Schedule a cron job to log disk usage daily:
echo "0 0 * * * df -h >> /var/log/disk_usage.log" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab

Monitor directory sizes using du:
du -sh /home/* >> /var/log/directory_usage.log

Use ps and head to identify resource-intensive processes:
ps aux | head -n 10 >> /var/log/process_monitor.log

Store all monitoring logs in /var/log/system_monitor/ for review.
mkdir -p /var/log/system_monitor
